# Webcam-Scanner-Based-on-OpenCV-for-Cpp

This is a program modified from an OpenCV tutorial: https://github.com/murtazahassan/Learn-OpenCV-cpp-in-4-Hours.

In this program, I used OpenCV to create a webcam scanner for files, however, it wasn't working very well, hope someone would help improving this program!!!
